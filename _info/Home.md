BonVision is an open-source closed-loop visual environment generator developed by the [Saleem Lab](www.saleemlab.com) and [Solomon Lab](www.solomonlab.info) at the [UCL Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience](http://www.ibn.ucl.ac.uk/) in collaboration with [NeuroGEARS](https://neurogears.org/).

*BonVision's key features include:*
* Naturally closed-loop system based on reactive coding of the Bonsai framework
* Handles 2D and 3D stimuli with equal ease
* Visual environment generated independent of display configuration
* Graphical programming language of the Bonsai framework
* Can be used for Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality or 2D visual stimuli
* Does not require the observer to be in a fixed position
