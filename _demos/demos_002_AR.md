This is a demo of a simple augmented reality, where there are four objects placed in front, and the view of the object is dependent on the observer's position.
You can download this demo from the Demo Package. This is called _ClosedLoop_. 

### Usage
This demo shows how to construct, render and interact with a more complicated environment, as you might in augmented reality. After pressing run, several objects (‘models’) appear, one of which is rotating around its core. 

Below is an example of what part of the visual display looks like during an experiment.
