This is a demo of creating a simple VR corridor (similar to Saleem et al., Nature, 2018).

You can download this demo from the [Demo Package](https://github.com/bonvision/examples). This is called _CorridorVR_. 

### Usage
Just hit Start in the menu. You can move through the VR by using the scroll wheel of the mouse. 
Once you reach the end of the corridor, you are teleported back to the start after a short interval. 

Here is how the output of this looks like:
