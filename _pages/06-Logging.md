We have split the logging into two components. In cases where precise stimulus timing is not critical  (eg. some psychophysics experiments), you can focus on just the first part, "Logging stimulus parameters". When stimulus timing is critical (eg. electrophysiology experiments), one would have to be careful with the next section too, "Logging screen times"

*** 
A. Logging stimulus parameters

*** 
B. Logging screen update / refresh times
